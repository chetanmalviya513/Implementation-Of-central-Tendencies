# Implementation of Central Tendencies using Python

This repository demonstrates the implementation of central tendency measures – **Mean, Median, and Mode** – using Python. These statistical measures are essential for understanding the distribution and central value of a dataset. The project is ideal for beginners in data science and statistics, providing hands-on experience with simple Python functions and real or sample data.

# What are Central Tendencies?

Central tendency is a statistical measure that identifies a single value as representative of an entire dataset. The three main measures are:

- Mean: The average of the data.
- Median: The middle value when the data is sorted.
- Mode: The most frequently occurring value.

# Tools & Libraries Used

- Python 
- Pandas – For data manipulation
- NumPy – For numerical operations
- Statistics – For built-in functions (optional)

# Project Structure

- `central_tendencies.py` – Python script with implementation of mean, median, and mode
- `sample_data.csv` – (Optional) Sample dataset used for demonstration
- `README.md` – Project documentation

# Features

- Manual implementation of mean, median, and mode
- Use of built-in and library methods for comparison
- Easy-to-read and well-commented code
- Supports both numerical arrays and real-world datasets
